# Simple-GUI-Calculator
This is a simple  GUI calculator which supports integer operands and some operations.
### Description
I developed this calculator by using Tkinter library in python programming language. You can do some mathematical operations using this calculator. However, this calculator only  support integer operands. You cannot do some operations on float numbers in this calculator. </br>
### Some Notes
1) // button does integer division. For example, 5 // 2  gives 2 result
2) reset button doesn't delete only the numbers on the screen but also this button deletes all memory and your previous operations.
